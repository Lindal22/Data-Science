1. Identify the problem is Supervised or UnSupervised. 
   * Supervised: You know what needs to be predicted. 
   * UnSupervised: No targets, we looks for structure/pattern of the data. 
     * Supervised:
        - Classification
        - Regression
     * Unsupervised
        - Clustering
        - Dimensionality Reduction 
        - Association/Recommendation

2. Loss Functions and Evaluation Metrics  
    - Evaluation Metrics Used in Regression Task
      * RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
      * RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)
      * MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
      * R-Squared (RÂ²)

    - Evaluation Metrics Used in 0/1 Prediction in Binary Classification Task
      * Accuracy and Error Rate
      * Precision and Recall
      * F1-Score and Fbeta-Score
      * MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)
      * Balanced Accuracy
      * Log Loss (or Cross Entropy or Negative Log-Likelihood)
      * AUCROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
  
3. Data Cleaning 
    - Download the datasets using `opendatasets` and merge datasets if needed.
    - Load using `pandas`
    - Check the data range - describe(), duplicate or invalid, negative data etc.
    - Null values - Check distribution of data, if normal distribution, `mean` / average is       fine, if exponential distribution then `median` should be fine or drop the rows, or         put 'Unknown' or fill with the average value of top and bottom rows etc. 
   - Check of how much data 
    
    
4. Data Viz and EDA
  - Study individual colum distribution - uniform, normal or exponential based on that you     can fill the missing values, if one column is exponential and it's correlation with to     target is exponential, then taking logarithm of the column would give you better           result. 
  - Detect anomalies or errors in the data (e.g. missing/incorrect values)
  - Study the relationship of target column with other columns (linear, non-linear etc.)
  - Gather insights about the problem and the dataset
  - Come up with ideas for preprocessing and feature engineering (ex: deriving new columns     from existing columns)
